State
    - "The state of the user, basically the history of the page kept on the server."
    - for web services, we control the state: API

Application Program Interface (API)
    - no user interface, only machine interface
    - Formats: XML, JSON
    - Protocol: REST, GraphQL, SOAP

- www.site/"?'string'=" - this is a "Get" request
- "Post" request - anytime you submit something, sends user data back to the server for processing and storage
- "Update & Delete" - updating a password example

- REST is for all of this stuff i think lol, HTTP VERBS
